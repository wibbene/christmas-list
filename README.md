Thing | Link | Notes
----| ---- | ---- |
Wifi 6 Access Point | [Link](https://store.ui.com/products/unifi-ap-6-lite) | I am ok with getting duplicates on this
Smart Power Plug | [Link](https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-accessories/products/unifi-smart-power) | This will allow me to automatically restart my modem if my system detects that the internet is down
Tripp Lite Power Strip | [Link](https://www.amazon.com/Tripp-Lite-Network-Grade-Wide-Spaced-RS1215-RA/dp/B00006B834/ref=sr_1_3?crid=26N15TJWVRBRA&dchild=1&keywords=tripp+lite+rackmount+power&qid=1635869993&sprefix=tripplite+rackmount%2Caps%2C88&sr=8-3) | I have run out of outlets in my homelab
Raspberry Pi | [Link](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) | I will need this for a class next year. I am ok with duplicates on this as this mini-computer can be used for many things
Patch Panel | [Link](https://www.amazon.com/Keystone-Support-Rapink-Pass-Thru-Removable/dp/B09FZKHH2G/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2TJF4LA9EBDZF&dchild=1&keywords=pass%2Bthru%2Bpatch%2Bpanel&qid=1635870292&sprefix=pass%2Bthru%2Bpatch%2Bpanel%2Caps%2C89&sr=8-4&th=1) | This helps with cable management

Unifi Switch Pro 24 POE | [Link](https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-switching/products/usw-pro-24-poe) | I have developed an actual need for this. Right now my Home Lab is limited to a speed of 1 Gigabit per second internally. This switch would allow more control over my network, Link Aggreation (this allows for one machine with mutiple internet wires coming out of it to be treated as one machine), Some Fiber Optic Capabilities and a max theoretical speed of 88 gigabits per second. This also allows for things to be powered by this switch, such a a camera.
Unifi Swtich Aggregation | [Link](https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-switching/products/unifi-switch-aggregation) | As I plan to add mutiple indepenedent machines to my homelab, this would make it possible for the machines to communicate with each other at  the fastest possible speed, 160 Gigabits per second. This also allows for fiber optic communication.
Unifi Access Starter Kit | [Link](https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-door-access/products/unifi-access-starter-kit) | I am crazy and I would like to make my house have card access while not using technology that I have privacy or security concerns about. We do have a smart door handle but I have discovered that this device, via our phones, sends personal data to a Chinese Company. This handle also uses bluetooth which has known vulnerabilities.
